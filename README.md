# üìà Stock Price Forecasting (AAPL)

This project forecasts Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using multiple time series and deep learning models: **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **LSTM**.
also we can do with other stocks as msft and other by just changing dataset in code it is easy.

## üîç Objective

Compare different forecasting techniques using:
- **Statistical models:** ARIMA, SARIMA
- **Machine learning models:** Prophet, LSTM
- Visualize forecast and evaluate model performance using RMSE and MAE.
